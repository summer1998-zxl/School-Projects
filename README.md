## Project 1: An R Notebook "Data Story" on the history of philosophy
The goal of this project is to write a data story on philosophy using the dataset for the Philosophy Data Project. Applying data mining, statistical analysis and visualization, students should derive interesting findings in this collection of philosophy texts and write a "data story" that can be shared with a general audience.

## Datasets
â€¢ The data sets can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/kouroshalizadeh/history-of-philosophy.

## Note
In this project I carried out an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of philosophy texts and write a blog on interesting findings about theology topic in philosophy from my analysis.

I also explored the text corpus using tools from data mining, statistical analysis and visualization, etc, and write a blog post using R Notebook.
